This is a great  opportunity for a reliable, flexible, and motivated caregiver or medical professional to use their skills in a home healthcare setting. \n\nI need people that will be available to work afternoon/evening shifts and/or overnight shifts.  I require 24/7 care so flexibility is important to help cover if other staff are unexpectedly out due to illness.  Please send your regular schedule availability so we see how you could fit into the schedule. \n\nABOUT ME:\nI'm a 37 year old tech and computer enthusiast with a Computer Engineering degree from UC Berkeley. I live near downtown Berkeley with my partner and dog. I have Muscular Dystrophy which makes my muscles very weak. I use a power wheelchair, ventilator and feeding tube. I mostly communicate by eye-tracking on a computer, and my caregivers do some lip reading.\n\nJOB DUTIES:\nWhile the job involves using some medical equipment, it mostly involves general caregiver tasks to allow me to comfortably and safely live my life. Tasks include positioning, range of motion exercises, personal care, transferring me into bed, giving medications, and other tasks as needed. I also have a tracheostomy for breathing, which means I cannot speak and am ventilator-dependent. While I mostly communicate with an eye tracking computer, you will also be taught to lip read my regular words.\n\nExtensive training is provided until we both feel comfortable and competent in your ability to perform all parts of the job independently. \n\nI need a highly responsible and attentive caregiver who quickly responds to my medical and care needs, once trained. \n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n–Experience with physical disabilities. Respiratory, ventilator and tracheostomy care highly desirable\n–Ability to lift at least 30 pounds (for positioning me)\n–Fluent English\n–Must commit to working at least one year, as paid training is a significant investment\n–Solid references from former employers; I will run a background check\n–Lip-reading experience preferred\n–Job requires some reaching, so if you're shorter than 5'4\", some tasks may be physically difficult\n–Valid drivers license preferred, but not required\n–Can reliably commit to a consistent schedule\n–Willingness and flexibility to back up shifts when other caregivers are out\n–Live within a reasonable commute from Berkeley\n\nSCHEDULE: \nWe will work with you to determine your training and permanent schedule, depending on your availability, interest, and skills.\n\nTraining involves a lot of time and effort for me, so I require at least a one year commitment. Some of my caregivers have been working with me for 5-10 years or more. Note that your training schedule may differ from your permanent schedule, which will be discussed.\n\nPAY: \n$30- $35/hr depending on relevant experience and credentials. I pay overtime, sick pay, bonuses, and give periodic raises. I also provide snacks on shift.\n\nLOCATION: \nI live 3 blocks from the Downtown Berkeley BART in my own home with my partner and dog. Free off-street parking is available.\n\nHOW TO APPLY: \nClick on the link to fill out the online application (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MuOAr8ytZo4Nwp1dMgpyup2AIHJZnN7AQi8Ju5B3M8I/viewform).\n\nIf you have problems with the application, please email me through Craigslist‬.
